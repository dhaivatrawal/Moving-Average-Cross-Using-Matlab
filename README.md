This project involves implementing and testing a moving average trading strategy using MATLAB, specifically applied to the daily closing prices of JustEat6M stock. The strategy is based on two moving averages: the 7-day moving average (7MA) and the 14-day moving average (14MA). The trading rules are straightforward:

Buy Signal: If the 7MA crosses the 14MA from below, the entire budget (Â£1M) is used to buy the stock.
Sell Signal: If the 7MA crosses the 14MA from above, the entire portfolio is sold.
Key components of the project include:

Data Import: The code imports daily closing prices from the provided JustEat6M file. It ensures compatibility without requiring file renaming or modifications.
Trading Strategy Implementation: The MATLAB script identifies the days on which the buy or sell conditions are met, updating the budget and portfolio values accordingly.
Output Generation: The script outputs buy/sell signals, along with the profit or loss for each transaction and the cumulative profit/loss.
Code Clarity and Documentation: The code is thoroughly commented to clarify the implementation of the trading strategy, data handling, and calculations.
The final deliverables include the MATLAB (.m) file, the code embedded in a report, and the resulting outputs. The project not only demonstrates practical application of moving average strategies but also emphasizes code readability and documentation.

Additionally, this project encompasses a second task that involves analyzing a dataset with 8 datapoints and three attributes/features, with the target values captured in a decision column. The analysis and results for this task are presented as part of the comprehensive report.

By implementing this project, users gain insights into algorithmic trading strategies and their application using MATLAB, providing a hands-on approach to financial data analysis and trading simulation.
